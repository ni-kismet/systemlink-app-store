# Contributing to Plugin Manager for SystemLink

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plugin Manager for SystemLink. This guide explains how to submit a plugin for inclusion in the curated catalog.

## Overview

The Plugin Manager uses a **curated, PR-based submission process** inspired by Homebrew. You submit a Pull Request containing your plugin metadata plus either the reviewed `.nipkg` itself or immutable GitHub release coordinates for that reviewed `.nipkg`, and maintainers review it before it becomes available in the catalog.

## Prerequisites

- A built SystemLink webapp (Angular, WebVI, or other — must produce an `index.html` at the root)
- The webapp packaged as a `.nipkg` file (see [Packaging your app](#packaging-your-app))
- Either the `.nipkg` stored in your submission directory or a GitHub release containing that exact `.nipkg`
- Package metadata embedded in the `.nipkg` control file, including `XB-DisplayName`, `XB-Plugin`, `XB-SlPluginManagerLicense`, and `XB-SlPluginManagerIcon`
- Optionally, up to 3 screenshots (PNG, max 800×600 px) stored next to the submission manifest

## Submission process

### 1. Prepare your submission directory

Create a directory under `submissions/` with your package name:

```
submissions/my-awesome-dashboard/
├── manifest.json           # Thin submission manifest (artifact path + hash)
├── screenshot1.png         # Screenshot (optional, max 3)
├── screenshot2.png         # Screenshot (optional)
└── my-awesome-dashboard_1.0.0_all.nipkg
```

If you already publish immutable release assets from another GitHub repository, you can omit the local `.nipkg` file and instead provide `sourceRepo` and `releaseTag` in the manifest. CI will download and validate the reviewed artifact from that release.

### 2. Write your `manifest.json`

Your `manifest.json` must conform to [`app-manifest.schema.json`](app-manifest.schema.json). It no longer duplicates package metadata. CI derives package name, version, display name, description, maintainer, license, plugin type, and icon directly from the reviewed `.nipkg`, whether that package is committed in the PR or resolved from the referenced GitHub release.

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "nipkgFile": "my-awesome-dashboard_1.0.0_all.nipkg",
  "sha256": "7b7f5d9c2d6e4d6f8d89b3a5b1f7dbe4b9f6b61f4c3b98b1e2f8d0a4c6d8e1f2",
  "sourceRepo": "yourorg/my-awesome-dashboard",
  "releaseTag": "my-awesome-dashboard-v1.0.0",
  "sourceCommit": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "screenshots": ["screenshot1.png"]
}
```

### 3. Submit a Pull Request

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b add/my-awesome-dashboard`
3. Add your `submissions/my-awesome-dashboard/` directory
4. Push and open a Pull Request

### 4. CI validation

The CI pipeline will automatically:

- Validate your `manifest.json` against the JSON Schema
- Resolve the reviewed `.nipkg` from the submission directory or the referenced GitHub release
- Verify that `sha256` matches the reviewed `.nipkg`
- Inspect the `.nipkg` archive structure
- Extract package metadata from the `.nipkg` control file
- Check for duplicate package names
- Verify `.nipkg` file size is ≤ 100 MB
- Validate that the package contains the required Plugin Manager metadata

### 5. Maintainer review

A maintainer will:

1. Install your app on a test SystemLink instance
2. Verify it works correctly
3. Check for CSP violations and security issues
4. Approve and merge

### 6. Publication

After merge, CI will:

1. Attach the reviewed `.nipkg` to a GitHub Release in this repository
2. Reuse the icon embedded in the `.nipkg` and base64-encode any submitted screenshots
3. Regenerate the `Packages` index
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Your plugin will be available in the Plugin Manager the next time users refresh their feed.

## Requirements for submitted apps

| Requirement     | Details                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manifest        | `manifest.json` must contain `schemaVersion`, `nipkgFile`, and the correct `sha256`    |
| Artifact source | Provide the `.nipkg` in the submission directory or provide both `sourceRepo` and `releaseTag` for a GitHub release asset matching `nipkgFile` |
| Package metadata | The `.nipkg` must contain `Section`, `XB-Plugin`, `Maintainer`, `XB-SlPluginManagerLicense`, `XB-DisplayName`, and `XB-SlPluginManagerIcon` |
| Content         | `.nipkg` must contain a valid webapp (`index.html` at root) or notebook (`.ipynb`)     |
| CSP             | No external network calls outside SystemLink's own APIs                                |
| Icon            | Must be embedded in the `.nipkg` as `XB-SlPluginManagerIcon`                           |
| Description     | ≥ 20 characters                                                                        |
| License         | Must be embedded in the package metadata (SPDX identifier or "Proprietary")            |
| Checksums       | SHA256 must match `.nipkg` contents                                                    |
| Version         | Valid semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)                                                     |
| Size            | ≤ 100 MB                                                                               |
| Naming          | Package name is first-come-first-served — CI rejects duplicates from different authors |

## Packaging your app

If you use the SystemLink CLI, you can package your webapp with:

```bash
slcli plugin-manager publish dist/browser/ \
  --name "my-awesome-dashboard" \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  --category "Dashboard" \
  --prepare-pr
```

This generates the `.nipkg` file, `manifest.json`, and a ready-to-commit branch.

Alternatively, you can manually create a `.nipkg` using NI Package Manager tools.

## Updating your app

To release a new version:

1. Build a new `.nipkg`
2. Recompute the `sha256` in your thin `manifest.json`
3. Submit a new Pull Request

---

## Automated submissions from other repositories

If your webapps live in a separate repository (e.g., `systemlink-enterprise-examples`), you can automate the submission process so that building a new version automatically creates a PR in this repository.

### How it works

```
Source repo (your webapps)              systemlink-plugin-manager
─────────────────────────               ────────────────────
1. Build webapp (ng build)
2. Package as .nipkg
3. Attach .nipkg to GitHub Release
4. Trigger repository_dispatch ────────► 5. accept-submission.yml runs
                                         6. Downloads .nipkg from your release
                                         7. Validates manifest against schema
                                         8. Creates branch submit/<pkg>-v<ver>
                                         9. Opens PR for review
```

### Setup

1. **Create a PAT** (classic) with `repo` scope that has access to the `systemlink-plugin-manager` repository. Store it as a secret named `PLUGIN_MANAGER_DISPATCH_TOKEN` in your source repository.

2. **Generate a thin submission manifest** during your release workflow after packaging the `.nipkg`. It must conform to [`app-manifest.schema.json`](app-manifest.schema.json).

3. **Add the publish workflow** to your source repository. See [`.github/examples/publish-to-plugin-manager.yml`](.github/examples/publish-to-plugin-manager.yml) for a complete, ready-to-use example with a 5-app matrix build.

### Manual cross-repo submission (local)

You can also use the `submit_package.py` script directly:

```bash
# From a clone of systemlink-plugin-manager
python scripts/submit_package.py \
    --manifest path/to/manifest.json \
  --nipkg path/to/my-app_1.0.0_all.nipkg

# This creates a local branch submit/my-app-v1.0.0
# Push and open a PR:
git push origin submit/my-app-v1.0.0
```

Or download from a GitHub Release:

```bash
python scripts/submit_package.py \
  --manifest-json '{"schemaVersion":2,"nipkgFile":"my-app_1.0.0_all.nipkg","sha256":"..."}' \
    --source-repo yourorg/your-repo \
    --release-tag my-app-v1.0.0 \
  --artifact-name my-app_1.0.0_all.nipkg \
    --create-pr
```

### Security notes

- The `repository_dispatch` event requires an authenticated API call — only users with the PAT can trigger it.
- The submission PR goes through the same CI validation and manual review as any other submission.
- The `submit_package.py` script only downloads from `github.com` release asset URLs to prevent SSRF.
- No code from the payload is executed — only metadata and binary artifacts are handled.

## Delisting / Deprecation

To request removal of your plugin, open an issue or submit a PR removing your submission directory. Deprecation is handled by adding `slPluginManagerDeprecated: yes` to the metadata — the plugin will show a warning badge but remain visible during a grace period.

## Questions?

Open an issue on this repository if you have questions about the submission process.
